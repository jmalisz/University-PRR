To use compile with `g++ *.cpp -o main -fopenmp -I .`

## Inputs:
- Accepts input from "Input.txt" file in current directory (first number in "Input.txt" is matrix size)
- Generates a random matrix with chosen size

To make file inputs easier there are a few matrices prepared.

## Outputs:
- Outputs to "Output.txt" file in current directory
- Console
